            <strong>Overview</strong>
          Global Jobs (P) Ltd is committed to respecting the privacy of our users. We strive to provide a safe, secure user experience. This Privacy Statement sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to the Global Jobs Web Site (sometimes referred to herein as the "Global Jobs Site") and does not apply to information we collect in any other fashion.  <br/>
          <br/>
         The Global Jobs Site contains links to other Web sites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web sites to which you choose to link from our Site. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.<br/>
          <br/>
          <h2>Collection and use of information by Global Jobs</h2>
          In some areas of Global Jobs, we request or may request that you provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, and any other information from which your identity is discernible. In other areas, we collect or may collect demographic information that is not unique to you such as your code, age, preferences, gender, interests and favorites. Sometimes we collect or may collect a combination of the two types of information. Examples of areas on the Global Jobs Site where we collect personal or combined personal and demographic data are pages where you can open a User account, sign up to use a service, post a resume.<br/>
          <br/>
          We also gather or may gather certain information about your use of Global Jobs, such as what areas you visit and what services you access. Moreover, there is information about your computer hardware and software that is or may be collected by us. This information can include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site addresses, but is not linked to your personal information.<br/>
          <br/>
          We may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide descriptive, cultural, and preferential and/or life style information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Statement. For example, such information may be used for the purpose of determining your potential interest in receiving e-mail or other communications about particular products or services.<br/>
          <br/>
          If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about the Global Jobs Site or refer a job posting to a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the Global Jobs Site or view the job posting. We do not store this information.<br/>
          <br/>
          <h2>Our use of your information</h2>
          We use the information we gather on Global Jobs Site, whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of operating and improving the Global Jobs Site, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.<br/>
          <br/>
          If you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available from us or our affiliated companies or to contact you about your opinion of current products and services or potential new products and services that may be offered.<br/>
          <br/>
         We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or other communications regarding updates at the Web Site, to contact you about your opinion of current products and services or potential new products and services that may be offered. We may also provide additional communications, promotions and information on new Global Jobs opportunities and additional job postings which may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you.<br/>
          <br/>
          We have areas on the Global Jobs Site where you can submit feedback. Any feedback you submit in these areas becomes our property, and we can use such feedback (such as success stories) for marketing purposes or to contact you for further information.<br/>
          <br/>
          <h2>Choices regarding the disclosure of personal information to others</h2></p>
          <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>1.	We disclose information to third parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you indicate that you would like to receive information about the opportunities, products or services of third parties at the time you register for a Global Jobs account, we supply your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters, data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular third-party.<br/>
            &nbsp; </li>
          <li>2.	We disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our Web servers, data, providing marketing assistance, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information as may necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other third party. 
  
 <br/>
            &nbsp; </li>
          <li>3.	We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public. <br/>
            &nbsp; </li>
          <li>4.	We disclose and transfer information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event we become the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, we or our trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. You will be notified of sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third party via email or through a prominent notice posted on the Global Jobs Site.  </li>
        </ol>
        <p><h2>Other uses of information</h2>
          We also share aggregated anonymous information about visitors to Global Jobs (for example, the number of visitors to Global Jobs' job search area) with its clients, partners and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Global Jobs Site and how those visitors use the Global Jobs Site.<br/>
          <br/>
          <h2>  Personal information on resumes and profiles</h2>
          Since Global Jobs is a career site, we give you three options regarding the accessibility of your resume:  </p>
        <ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>1.	You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to be searchable by potential employers. Not allowing your resume to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume database product..<br/>
            &nbsp; </li>
          <li>2.	If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it confidential and hiding your contact information, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. <br/>
            &nbsp; </li>
          <li>3.	If you have a confidential resume, but apply to a job posting on Global Jobs, the employer to whom you send your resume will be able to view your contact information.  </li>
        </ol>

Alternatively, you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on Global Jobs Site.<br/>
